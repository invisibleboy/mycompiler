# Run 'read_platform_info --help | more' for documentation.
#
# Platform info module for: x86lin gcc
#
# See www.trimaran.org for Trimaran-based testing and porting info.
#
# Note: Running 'compile_bench' or 'compile_list' on a NFS mounted drive 
#       (served by a Sun Solaris 5.6 server) did *not* work for us.  IMPACT 
#       scripts randomly failed because Linux intermittently claimed that a 
#       file was not there that our script had just created (and showed up on 
#       an 'ls').  For example: 'ls > list; cat < list' would randomly claim
#       the file 'list' could not be found.  Rerunning the script would 
#       cause another failure in a different place!  
# 
#       Compile benchmarks on a local drive or use a Linux NFS server for 
#       your Linux boxes (both have worked for us)!
#
# IMPACT-based testing history for this platform info:
#
#   7/12/99  IMPACT version 2.33     
#            Red Hat Linux 6.0 (Kernel 2.2.5-15) and gcc (egcs-2.91.66)

#            Benchmark sets tested (all benchmark names in 'list' below):

#
#                 All benchmarks PASSED except:
#
#                  a) 099.go/input2: same as above
#
#                  b) 126.gcc: undiagnosed Lprofile punt.

#                 
#                 All benchmarks PASSED except:

#                  a) 099.go/input1: undiagnosed coredump during execution.
#                     099.go/input[2-4]: not run.
#
#                  b) 126.gcc: undiagnosed Lprofile punt.
#
#                  c) 072.sc/input[1-9]: undiagnosed MISMATCHes.
#            
#
#   7/12/99  IMPACT version 2.33     
#            Red Hat Linux 5.1 (Kernel 2.0.35) and gcc (2.7.2.3)
#
#            Benchmark sets tested (all benchmark names in 'list' below):

#                     099.go/input[1,2,4]: PASSED.
# 
#
#             Note: S and HS not tested on RedHat 5.1, but expect similar to 
#                   RedHat 6.0 results shown above.
#
# In the past, we have run regressions on RedHat 5.2 (Kernel 2.2.7) and
# gcc (2.7.2.3) and received similar results.  We have been told this also 
# works well on Caldera OpenLinux 2.2.
