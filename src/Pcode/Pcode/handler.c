 * \author Robert Kidd and Wen-mei Hwu
 *
 * Defines a default P_def_handlers function that can be overridden by
 * a module.
 *
 * \note We rely on ld to do the overriding.  P_def_handlers will be used
 * from this file only if it is not defined by the module.  If anything
 * besides P_def_handlers is defined in this file, this file may be
 * linked even if the module defines P_def_handlers, causing a link error
 * due to two definitions of P_def_handlers.
