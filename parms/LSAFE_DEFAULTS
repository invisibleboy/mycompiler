    # WARNING 
    #
    # If you want to perform any of this analysis, filelist_file_name
    # must be a pointer to a real file containing the file names. 
    # Callgraph generation makes multiple passes on the functions.
    # Marking side effect free function calls uses the list to produce
    # a list of output files.


    # This option is used to identify jsr's to functions that do not write
    # to memory - Side Effect Free.

    # The extension appended to the end of the origional file name.

    # that are actually safe.

    #
    # Analysis levels:
    #   0 = trivial analysis (only at operation level)
    #   1 = intra-procedural analysis
    #   2 = inter-procedural analysis

    # This says whether an arc to an unknown function will be replaced
    # arcs to all functions.  Conservative accuracy requires this to be
    # enabled.  If you want to known how accurate the callgraph generation
    # was, then set this to no and turn on print_callgraph.  This will tell
    # you exactly which instructions could not be resolved.
