#   parameter settings, except for the rare parameter override specified in the 
#   benchmark's compile_parms file that must be done for proper compilation.  
#   If used with the default compile_bench parameters, IMPACT's full, 
#   aggressive set of ILP optimizations will be performed.
#
#   DO NOT OVERRIDE ANY PARAMETERS IN THE "full" PROJECT PARMS FILE!
#
#   Sample usage (using compile_bench default parameter settings):
#
#       setenv DEFAULT_PROJECT full
#       compile_bench wc
#
#       -OR-
#
#       compile_bench wc -project full
#
#
#   Sample usage (using user's parameter settings for paper99):
#
#       setenv DEFAULT_PROJECT full
#       compile_bench wc -p ~/STD_PARMS.paper99
#
#
#   Note: Some large benchmarks make take more than 1GB memory and more
#         than 24 hours to process with the full project.  Consider using 
#         the special less_memory project if some parameter tweaking 
#         by the project is acceptable.  If you need total control,
#         including the need to bypass the benchmark's compile_parms 
#         parameter overrides, see the full_unsafe project.
#
#   Note: For many functions, the default compile_bench parameters will 
#         generate hyperblocks that are too aggressive and will degrade 
#         performance for those functions.
